Build a single-page luxury jewelry ecommerce website in English using React + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui.

GOAL
Create a premium English-language homepage for a fictional luxury jewelry maison called Maison Perle.

The site should feel like a shoppable oil-painting exhibition inspired by the emotional atmosphere of "Girl with a Pearl Earring":
- dark
- museum-grade
- quiet
- elegant
- cinematic
- collectible

This is not a generic ecommerce template, not a SaaS landing page, and not a fashion campaign collage.

The website must use EdgeOne Pages Edge Functions for lightweight backend functionality.

BRAND RULES
Brand name: Maison Perle

Color world:
- deep Prussian blue-black
- ultramarine silk blue
- pearl ivory
- muted champagne gold

Pearl rule:
Pearls must look perfectly round or near-spherical, smooth, symmetrical, luminous, and high-jewelry grade.
Do not generate baroque, lumpy, irregular, distorted, or asymmetrical pearls.

Avoid:
- recognizable luxury brand logos
- iconic brand silhouettes
- neon sci-fi lighting
- startup aesthetics
- loud commercial jewelry-ad styling
- collage-style fashion layouts

TECH STACK
- React
- Vite
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui
- lucide-react
- motion / framer-motion
- tailwindcss-animate

FONTS
Use Google Fonts:
- Cormorant Garamond (500, 600, 700, italic) for headings
- Manrope (300, 400, 500, 600) for body text

Tailwind font families:
- heading: ["Cormorant Garamond", "serif"]
- body: ["Manrope", "sans-serif"]

CSS VARIABLES
Define these in src/index.css:

:root {
  --background: 220 34% 6%;
  --foreground: 35 28% 95%;
  --primary: 41 42% 74%;
  --primary-foreground: 220 34% 6%;

  --border: 35 25% 92% / 0.14;
  --card: 220 24% 10%;
  --radius: 9999px;
}

Typography:
- headings: font-heading italic, elegant, tight leading, ivory tone
- body text: font-body, light, muted ivory
- buttons: rounded-full, refined, tactile, premium

GLASS COMPONENTS
Create two reusable component styles in @layer components:

.museum-glass
- background: rgba(255,255,255,0.03)
- backdrop-filter: blur(10px) saturate(120%)
- border: 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.08)
- box-shadow: inset 0 1px 0 rgba(255,255,255,0.08), 0 12px 40px rgba(0,0,0,0.22)
- position: relative
- overflow: hidden
- subtle luxury gradient border effect using ::before

.museum-glass-strong
- same structure
- stronger blur
- stronger shadow
- slightly brighter border treatment
- use for primary CTA buttons and important overlay cards

NON-NEGOTIABLE LAYOUT RULES
The site may feel editorial and cinematic, but the layout itself must remain stable, structured, and production-grade.

Do not do any of the following:
- no overlapping collage layouts
- no floating image clusters
- no negative margins for decorative offset
- no staggered text/image misalignment
- no sticky split editorial panels
- no freeform magazine-style composition
- no text drifting outside its wrapper
- no cards breaking grid alignment
- no decorative motion affecting layout flow

Global layout rules:
- Use one centered content container for all non-full-bleed content
- Max width: 1280px
- Horizontal padding: px-6 md:px-10 lg:px-16
- Use mx-auto consistently
- Standard section spacing: py-24 md:py-32
- Keep vertical rhythm consistent
- Keep headings, body copy, and CTA groups inside predictable wrappers

Media rules:
- Background media must be absolute inset-0 only
- Foreground content must be inside a separate relative z-10 wrapper
- Background media uses object-cover
- Media sections must keep stable heights
- Cards and grids remain in normal document flow

Grid rules:
- Collections: 1 col mobile, 2 col tablet, 3 equal-width cards desktop
- Products: 2 col mobile, 3 col desktop
- Testimonials: 1 col mobile, 3 col desktop
- Stats: 2 col mobile, 4 col desktop

Aspect ratio rules:
- Collection cards: 4:5
- Product cards: 4:5
- Keep card heights consistent within the same row
- Do not mix random heights

Responsiveness:
- Intentionally design mobile, tablet, desktop
- Prevent overflow, collisions, broken nav, or drifting CTAs
- Check 390px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px

Final layout priority:
If artistic direction conflicts with layout stability, choose layout stability.

BACKGROUND MEDIA COMPONENT
Create a reusable BackgroundMedia component that supports:
- videoSrc?: string
- imageSrc?: string
- poster?: string
- overlay?: boolean
- className?: string

Rules:
- use video when videoSrc exists
- use image as poster / fallback only when the image URL is valid
- if both poster and image fallback are unavailable, render a stable dark Prussian-black background instead of showing a broken asset
- autoplay, muted, loop, playsInline
- preserve text readability with dark overlays and fade gradients
- keep layout unchanged if media source changes later
